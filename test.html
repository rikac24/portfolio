            <p id="a1"> Pdos Pdong, a name more understandable in Khmer and a 
                bilingual platform, 
                wants to stimulate human connections through storytelling. 
                There is something inherently instilled in each human, 
                and that is the urge to connect and socialize.
                We collected stories in person and online from different 
                people in Cambodia as well as foreigners. Stories collected 
                are mostly written in terms of our perspectives, showing how 
                weâ€™ve been impacted by it. Within this project, we also have 
                movements such as the self-love movement in which we collected 
                testimonies from different people in order to spread positive 
                messages.
