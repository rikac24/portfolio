            <p id="a1"> Pdos Pdong, a name more understandable in Khmer and a 
                bilingual platform, 
                wants to stimulate human connections through storytelling. 
                There is something inherently instilled in each human, 
                and that is the urge to connect and socialize.
                We collected stories in person and online from different 
                people in Cambodia as well as foreigners. Stories collected 
                are mostly written in terms of our perspectives, showing how 
                weâ€™ve been impacted by it. Within this project, we also have 
                movements such as the self-love movement in which we collected 
                testimonies from different people in order to spread positive 
                messages.

            <p id="a1"> Started as a group of eight highly passionate students
                on marine science, LMRT has now evolved to form its second
                generation of young scientists who are determined to preserve
                the dying jewels of Cambodia. Initiated in 2017, these young
                scuba divers work with MCC or Marine Conservation Cambodia in 
                order to deploy artifical reefs in decimated areas and conduct
                reef surveys, collecting data on fish and invertebrates 
                populations as well as assessing substrate growth.
